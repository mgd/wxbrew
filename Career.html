        <p>My career started in the Air Force as a Weather Officer in 2011. 
            At my first duty station at Hickam AFB, HI our primary job was to produce forecast, watches, warnings, and advisories for inclement weather over the PACOM region. 
            As an officer I was also taught how to supervise, discipline, create work schedules, brief high level officials, create standard procedures, and many other skills. 
            From there, the AF sent me to school to pursue a M.S. degree in Meteorology where I became more familiar with Numerical Weather Prediction NWP. 
            While doing my masters, I realized I needed a better understanding of coding to really do what I wanted, but was still able to accomplish a thorough thesis. 
            I was then sent to Offutt AFB, where I was Chief of the Model Verification team, who as you might guess verified NWP models with various statistical methods. 
            After leaving the AF in 2018 I decided to go back to school for computer science to pursue a better understanding of the underlying nature of NWP models and how they work. 
            While in school I have completed two internships, the first over summer of 2019 at Prudential Financial, and the second over the summer of 2020 at Northrup Grumman. 
            During my internship with Northrup, I was offered a job and will start in Jan/Feb of 2021 pending I graduate this semester. 
            As for career goals, I feel I am a bit "late in the game" in terms of knowledge to work at a company like Facebook or Space X, 
            instead I would much rather focus on jobs that give a good work life balance and are good to their employees.</p>
