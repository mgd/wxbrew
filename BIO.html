        <p> I grew up in Jacksonville, FL and after graduating high school in 2006 I attended FSCJ for my AA.
            I then transferred to FSU for their meteorology program and graduated in spring of 2011. 
            After a few months of teaching surf lessons, I was accepted into Officer Training School with the Air Force.
            My first duty station as a Weather Officer was at Hickam AFB, HI on the island of Oahu. 
            During my time there I enjoyed surfing, hiking, snorkeling and playing guitar for a small church. 
            I also applied for a competitive assignment to go back to school for a M.S. Degree in Meteorology and as luck would have it I was accepted and attended FSU. 
            Upon completion of my thesis, I was then sent to Offutt AFB in Omaha, NB where I headed up weather model validation section/team. 
            After leaving the Air Force I decided to use my GI-BILL to go back to school, yet again, but this time for computer science.</p>
